## Note : This library is designed for personal use.

## If you want to use it anyway :

1. Download the **Colors4Terminal.h** file.	

2. Add it to your project.

3. Include the header in your code : **Colors4Terminal.h**.

4. Optional : Call **EnableVirtualTerminal()** at the start of your program.
	In most cases this isn't required, but it ensures compatibility.

5. Don't forget to use the namespace 'CFT'.
